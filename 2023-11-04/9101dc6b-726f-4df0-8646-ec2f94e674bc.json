Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication. Tor Guards and Authority nodes act as initial gateways into a Tor network. This traffic can indicate that this EC2 instance is acting as a client on a Tor network. A common use for a Tor client is to circumvent network monitoring and filter for access to unauthorized or illicit content. Tor clients can also generate nefarious Internet traffic, including attacking SSH servers. This activity can indicate that your EC2 instance is compromised.\"}]}"
