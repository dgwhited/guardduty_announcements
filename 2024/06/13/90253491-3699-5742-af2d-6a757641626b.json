      "featureDescription": "Amazon GuardDuty announces Malware Protection for S3 that automatically scans newly uploaded objects to your selected Amazon S3 buckets for potential malware, viruses, and other suspicious uploads. The feature provides an option to add tags to your scanned objects and publishes the S3 object scan result to Amazon EventBridge. You can further build downstream workflows, such as isolation to a quarantine bucket, or define bucket policies using tags that prevent users or applications from accessing certain objects. You can use this feature without enabling the GuardDuty service in your account."
